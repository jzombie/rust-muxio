# Muxio: A High-Performance Multiplexing and RPC Framework for Rust

**DRAFT -- WORK IN PROGRESS**

Muxio provides a robust and flexible foundation for building high-performance, transport-agnostic, and runtime-agnostic services in Rust. It offers a layered architecture that cleanly separates low-level binary stream multiplexing from high-level RPC logic, enabling you to create custom-tailored communication protocols.

## What is Muxio?

At its core, Muxio is a set of layered components that enable multiplexed data transmission over a single, unified connection. Think of it as a toolkit for managing multiple, independent data streams, such as RPC calls, file transfers, and real-time data feedsâ€”without the overhead of multiple connections.

On top of this multiplexing layer, Muxio offers a minimal, unopinionated RPC framework. While you can use it directly, it's often more practical to leverage the provided extensions, which offer ready-to-use solutions for common environments (such as `tokio` or `WASM`).

----------

## Key Features

- **Efficient Multiplexing**: Muxio's foundational framing protocol can reliably manage numerous concurrent data streams over a single connection, correctly reassembling interleaved and out-of-order frames.

- **Minimalist RPC Layer**: A lightweight RPC mechanism is provided on top of the framing layer, giving you the freedom to choose your own serialization formats, dispatching logic, and error-handling strategies.

- **Low-Overhead Binary Protocol**: Muxio uses a compact binary framing protocol to minimize data transmission overhead, making it highly efficient for performance-sensitive applications. All communication, from frame headers to RPC payloads, is handled as raw bytes. The protocol defines a minimal header structure to keep data transfer lean.

- **Transport and Runtime Agnostic**: The core logic uses a flexible, callback-driven design, enabling seamless adaptation across different environments. It supports both Tokio and standard library servers, as well as native and WASM clients, with or without Tokio.

- **Extensible by Design:** Muxio comes with pre-built extensions that demonstrate how to integrate the core library into real-world applications:.

  - **Tokio-based [Server](./extensions/muxio-tokio-rpc-server/)/[Client](./extensions/muxio-tokio-rpc-client/)]**: For native, multi-threaded environments.
  - **[WASM-based Web Client](./extensions/muxio-wasm-rpc-client/)**: For seamless integration into web applications, communicating with a JavaScript host via a simple byte-passing bridge.

## Core Use Cases & Design Philosophy

Muxio is engineered to solve specific challenges in building modern, distributed systems. Its architecture and features are guided by the following principles:

- **Low-Latency, High-Performance Communication**: Muxio is built for speed. It uses a compact, **low-overhead binary protocol** (instead of text-based formats like JSON). This significantly reduces the size of data sent over the network and minimizes the CPU cycles needed for serialization and deserialization. By avoiding complex parsing, Muxio lowers end-to-end latency, making it well-suited for real-time applications such as financial data streaming, multiplayer games, and interactive remote tooling.

- **Cross-Platform Code with Agnostic Frontends**: Write your core application logic once and deploy it across multiple platforms. Muxio achieves this through its generic [`RpcServiceCallerInterface` trait](./extensions/muxio-rpc-service-caller/src/caller_interface.rs), which abstracts away the underlying transport. The same application code that calls an RPC method can run on a native [`RpcClient`](./extensions/muxio-tokio-rpc-client/) using Tokio or a RpcWasmClient in a web browser with no changes, while additional client types can be added with minimal code, provided they implement the same aformentioned `RpcServiceCallerInterface`. This design ensures that improvements to the core service logic benefit all clients simultaneously, even custom-built clients.

- **Shared Service Definitions for Type-Safe APIs**: Enforce integrity between your server and client by defining RPC methods, inputs, and outputs in a shared crate. By implementing the [`RpcMethodPrebuffered` trait](./extensions/muxio-rpc-service-caller/src/prebuffered/) , both client and server depend on a single source of truth for the API contract. This completely eliminates a common class of runtime errors, as any mismatch in data structures between the client and server will result in a compile-time error.

- **A Strong Foundation for Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI)**: The framework's byte-oriented design makes it an ideal foundation for bridging Rust with other languages. Because the core dispatcher only needs to receive and emit byte slices, you can easily create an FFI layer that connects Muxio to C, C++, Swift, or any language that can handle byte array (including Python). The included [`muxio-wasm-rpc-client`](./extensions/muxio-wasm-rpc-client/) serves as a perfect example, using #[wasm_bindgen] to create a simple bridge between the Rust client and the JavaScript host environment.

## Key Features

- **Multiplexed Framing Layer**: The base of Muxio is a powerful framing protocol that supports multiple, independent, and concurrent data streams over a single connection. It correctly reassembles interleaved and out-of-order frames.

- **Primitive & Unopinionated RPC Layer**: On top of the framing layer sits a lightweight RPC mechanism. It provides the ability to send requests with metadata and a payload, and receive responses, without imposing strict design patterns.

- **Callback-Driven Core**: The core logic is runtime-agnostic and uses a flexible callback-based approach, making it adaptable to any execution environment.

- **Extensible by Design**: Muxio comes with pre-built extensions that demonstrate how to integrate the core library into real-world applications:

  - **Tokio-based Server/Client**: For native, multi-threaded environments.

  - **WASM Client**: For seamless integration into web applications.

## Core Concepts

Muxio is built on a two-layer architecture:

1. **Framing Layer** (`muxio::frame`)

This is the foundation of the library. It is responsible for taking a stream of bytes and breaking it into frames, each with a header containing a stream_id and seq_id.

The `FrameMuxStreamDecoder` is the key component here. It can process a raw byte stream from any source (like a TCP or WebSocket connection) and will correctly reassemble frames that arrive interleaved or out of order, buffering them until they can be processed sequentially.

2. **RPC Layer** (`muxio::rpc`)

This layer provides the fundamental building blocks for RPC communication. It uses the framing protocol to transmit structured messages: RpcRequest and RpcResponse. This layer is intentionally minimal, giving you control over serialization, method dispatch, and error handling.
