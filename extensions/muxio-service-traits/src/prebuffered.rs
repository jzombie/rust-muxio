// These are optional helper traits that define a convention for encoding and
// decoding RPC method data using pre-buffered (i.e., fully materialized) payloads.
//
// These traits are not used by the core Muxio framework directly â€” it is up to
// the consuming application to adopt them if desired. They provide a structured,
// ergonomic way to couple method metadata (such as `METHOD_ID`) with
// serialization logic in a single location.
//
// These traits assume that the transport has already buffered the complete
// request or response body, making them unsuitable for streaming scenarios.
// In cases requiring incremental transmission, alternative traits or interfaces
// should be used instead.
